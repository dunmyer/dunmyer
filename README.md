- 👋 Hi, I’m @dunmyer
- 👀 I’m interested in Liverpool Football Club, National Parks, Tech, Bourbon, and historic shit of all kinds. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning too much. Probably need to focus a bit. Very interested in robotics using reinforcement learning and IoT.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a non-profit that is teaching critical tech skills.
- 📫 You can easily find me on LinkedIn. I'm the bald Bob Dunmyer!
